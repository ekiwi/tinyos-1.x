/**
 * A bit-level interface to the mote radio. The radio has two states,
 * transmit and receive, and can be set. The sampling/interrupt rate
 * can be adjusted to one of three values: 0 (double sampling), 1
 * (one-and-a=half-sampling) and 2 (single sampling).
 *
 * <p> This interface, as it directly abstracts hardware, follows the
 * hardware interface convention of not maintaining state. Therefore,
 * some conditions that could be understood by a higher layer to be
 * errors execute properly; for example, one can call
 * <code>txBit</code> when in receive mode. A higher level interface
 * must provide the checks for conditions such as this.
 *
 * <p> This interface makes no sense to me. Where's the rxBit event? 
 * Why is there an rxBit command? -pal
